# Bidfta-Extension

Does nothing yet, just boilerplate code, 
some future features include 
an alarm for items that you add to your watchlist, 
replacement of bidder ids with specified list of bidderid-user,
warning while bidding that one of your "friends" from previous feature is in the bid history
maybe a link to amazon item page?
more to come as i think of things
